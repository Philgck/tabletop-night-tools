Initial commit and readme. This project was created using the code institute template. 

The intent of this project is to create a single site that contains multiple different tools that will help with running tabletop gaming nights. The primary functionality I intend to implement is a boardgame library app, built using Django, that enables users to store their board game library in a single location with access to information like "Player count" and "Average play length". Users will be able to update their library of games, delete entries from it, create entries to it, and view its contents. 

Could haves with regards to this project are a friends list so you can share your library with other users, view your shared library between friends, and create events that will automatically consider the maximum player counts and who is attending in order to show what games could potentially be played. Further intent is to add other apps that will help with running role playing games, and the sharing of "homebrew" content with other users. 

This initial commit and intial readme exists to record the intent of the project as it started, and to try and limit scope to make sure that the above is completed prior to adding further tools.
